    * Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses

    * Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Remember to make
      sure that the user puts in a letter!
    
    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess 
      about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.

    * After each guess, you should display to the user the 
      partially guessed word so far.
